overviewTitle: Visualising businesses social impact

overviewDescription: Virgin Atlantic has a number of digital experiences that are resposnible for key areas of the customer journey; from browsing holiday destinations to booking a flight, accessing inflight entertainment and staying connected in the skies, the list is endless. These experiences are managed by different teams and often built using a different design systems with varying levels of maturity. Some even built locally without a design system in the loop. This makes it near impossible to make any global changes to the identity of Virgin Atlantic's digital experiences, without huge time and effort costs. 

problemStatement: Virgin Atlantic needed a design system to act as a signle source of truth for all scrum teams, to help maintain a consistent brand, user experience, as well as improve business efficiency when implementing new features.
