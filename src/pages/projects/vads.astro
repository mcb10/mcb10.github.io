          Virgin Atlantic has a number of digital experiences that are
          resposnible for key areas of the customer journey; from exploring
          holiday destinations to flight booking, inflight entertainment access,
          and connectivity in the skies. However, these experiences are managed
          by different teams and often developed using different design systems
          with varying levels of maturity. In some cases, some are built locally
          without a design system in the loop. This fragmentation poses a
          significant challenge, making it nearly impossible to implement global
          changes to the identity of Virgin Atlantic's digital experiences
          without substantial time and effort investments.

        <p class="body-display">
          Virgin Atlantic needed a design system to serve as a single source of
          truth for all scrum teams. This would aim to uphold a consistent brand
          identity, an enhanced user experience, and an overall improved
          efficiency during the implementation of new features and proof of
          concept work.

        <p class="body-display">
          Given the presence of multiple design systems within Virgin Atlantic,
          I took the initiative to <strong
            >conduct a comprehensive audit of each system</strong
          >. The goal was to gain a detailed understanding of the necessity for
          each component and pattern, spanning both the Virgin Atlantic and
          Virgin Atlantic Holidays brands. Simultaneously, I delved into <strong
            >research on renowned design systems</strong
          >, including IBM Carbon, Atlassian, and Material Design. This
          groundwork was essential for <strong
            >constructing a robust business case, highlighting the advantages of
            establishing a unified source of truth for both designers and
            developers.

        <p class="body-display">
          To determine the scope for the first phase of our project, we <strong
            >established key principles</strong
          > that would distinguish which elements are designated as design system
          components and which would be retained locally within individual scrum
          teams. These principles were outlined as follows:

              To create a solid foundation for the design system, I documented
              the styles avaliable which included designing and testing
              accessible colour ramps in both light and dark themes. I also
              created responsive typography that scaled across devices,
              introudced an inclusive iconography set, and solidifyied a
              responsive layout incorporating grids and spacing.

      <p class="body-display">
        Virgin Atlantic Design System continues to grow and evolve, with more
        digital projects utilising the design system. It is the cornerstone of
        our visual design language and has played an essential part in changing
        the company's perception of design systems.
