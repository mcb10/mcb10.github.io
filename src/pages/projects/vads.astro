                Virgin Atlantic has a number of digital experiences that are
                resposnible for key areas of the customer journey; from
                exploring holiday destinations to flight booking, inflight
                entertainment access, and connectivity in the skies. However,
                these experiences are managed by different teams and often
                developed using different design systems with varying levels of
                maturity. In some cases, some are built locally without a design
                system in the loop. This fragmentation poses a significant
                challenge, making it nearly impossible to implement global
                changes to the identity of Virgin Atlantic's digital experiences
                without substantial time and effort investments.

                Virgin Atlantic needed a design system to serve as a single
                source of truth for all scrum teams. This would aim to uphold a
                consistent brand identity, an enhanced user experience, and an
                overall improved efficiency during the implementation of new
                features and proof of concept work.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p class="body-display">
                Given the presence of multiple design systems within Virgin
                Atlantic, I took the initiative to <strong>conduct a comprehensive audit
                of each system</strong>. The goal was to gain a detailed understanding of
                the necessity for each component and pattern, spanning both the
                Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Atlantic Holidays brands.
                Simultaneously, I delved into <strong>research on renowned design
                systems</strong>, including IBM Carbon, Atlassian, and Material Design.
                This groundwork was essential for <strong>constructing a robust business
                case, highlighting the advantages of establishing a unified
                source of truth for both designers and developers.

                Begin with discussions and brainstorms with the team during the

                challenges they face.
